1) How to control the end of string with new line
- : minus used when we do not want the new line at the end, for example in default we have 'application/n', 
use '-' we will have 'application.'
    For example:
        about: |-
        EasyBank
        is an 
        Bank based
        application.

+ : plus used when we want to keep the multiple new line at the end, for example in default we have 'application/n', use '+' and enter multiple line in string, 
we will have 'application./n/n/n' which depends on how many new line we enter
    For example:
        about: |+
        EasyBank
        is an 
        Bank based
        application.
